Me and the Tampere Uni team placed 2nd out of the 8 AI teams in the 2025 [Earth Rover Challenge](https://earth-rover-challenge.github.io/) organized by [FrodoBots](https://www.frodobots.ai/)!

The challenge involved navigating a real rover robot through a series of GPS checkpoints in 8 distinct locations around the world, while only relying on a limited suite of onboard sensors. Our imitation learning based navigation policy performed quite nicely!
